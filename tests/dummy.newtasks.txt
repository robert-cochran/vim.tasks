    IDEA:       Folding is useful for certain filetypes that contain lots of tasks
                in a single txt file, for instance tests. Any long txt file is a 
                good candidate here (especially since I have a very structured way
                of writing out tasks/notes now).
    DRAWBACK:   In the long run its better to have a collection of files that
                can reference each other, since you'll want to reference 
                certain files from other files to make finding content easier
                (e.g. tasks parents to children, hashtags, help docs, etc.)

    FOLDING:    I got this method below to work with folding up blocks of txt 
                starting with TASK: and ending with \n\n, but there are some
                strange bugs (e.g. a task inside of a task will fold the second
                task first and leave the top one to cover all other tasks 
                (since its looking for a corresponding \n\n and all the other
                tasks have taken them, so the first one just subsumes them all)
    SYNTAX:     in the .vim/syntax/txt.vim add these lines
    CODE        syn region taskFold start=/TASK:.*/ end="\n\n" transparent fold
                syn sync fromstart
    ACTIVATE    either do this in a file to see or add it to your vimrc to make
                it permanent
