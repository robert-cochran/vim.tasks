INDENTING

    These are all (?) the vim variables that govern indenting, indent
    vars seem like they would be useful for my todo tracking keeping
    things in columns

    set expandtab       "Use softtabstop spaces instead of tab characters for indentation
    set shiftwidth=4    "Indent by 4 spaces when using >>, <<, == etc.
    set softtabstop=4   "Indent by 4 spaces when pressing <TAB>
    set autoindent      "Keep indentation from previous line
    set smartindent     "Automatically inserts indentation in some cases
    set cindent         "Like smartindent, but stricter and more customisable
