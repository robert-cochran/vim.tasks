    NOTE:       for syntax regex matching, hs and he determine what the exclude from
                the highlight.
    EXAMPLE:    syntax match txtPROJ        /PROJECT\s\+\w\+.*/hs=s+1,he=e-1
                would select "PROJECT   ML FOR DUMMIES" but the first and last
                chars wouldnt be highlighted
