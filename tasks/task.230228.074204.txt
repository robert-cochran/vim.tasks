    FEATURE:    would be nice to have each task/test become their own file that
                will if need be that will link back up to other files 
                (org-mode seems to have the folding tasks aspect) 
                Idea being that each of these tasks and subtasks should be
                written as self contained units with a beginning (context), 
                middle (notes, debug, Q, TEST, OUTCOME, etc..) and end (STATUS).
                that way I can keep track of tasks in their own window without
                needing all the other subtasks and notes necessarily right next
                to what my current task is. also makes it more standardised 
                for templates
