    QUESTION    How should I do filenames. task.parent.child.txt, or 
                task.uuid.txt. at least with the second you know what the last
                thing you worked on was, and you cant tell that with the first
                since you can go back up the tree and not know where you were
                before. but the second way shows the relationship more easily
                so that you can drill down through the filesystem
                only issue is needing to manually manage all those file names
                is one more thing to think about and the point of this is to
                minimise thinking. 
                the easiest way would be to timestamp every new task as
                task.yymmddhhmmss.txt . but how are you supposed to find 
                files you just stored a task into? sort by name i guess and
                manually go through? is there a way to attach a name to the 
                task in the parent txt file when its created?
                also how do i automate creating a timestamped file?
