    QUESTION    is it better (short or long term) to have all tasks for a
                single ticket or project in a single file that can be folded
                up whenever but require either manual fold setting or complex
                folding syntax, OR to have each task in its own file to reduce
                clutter in a single file but then introduce the complexity of 
                linking files together to ease navigation and skeleton 
                templates that need to be auto refreshed to see any content
                thats been updated
                on one hand, tasks with their own files will be able to have
                more custom, flexible, adhoc structure since it wont be relying
                on custom folding syntax, but on the other it makes finding 
                content easier since everything is in this one file (but really
                using bash commands this should be easy to find strings 
                amongst a dir of files too).
                single file also makes indenting not really an option and will
                require me to be much more diligent with following the syntax
