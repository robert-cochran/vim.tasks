    FEATURE     add a new syntax for Q!: when a question has been answered.
                could do similar thing for a test when its done. or a task 
                or subtask even?
                or could do Q-: if having ! could cause problems, not sure
                could even have that as a general rule for any keyword ending 
                in a ! (or whatever special character i define) will result in
                darker text to denote its not needed anymore
