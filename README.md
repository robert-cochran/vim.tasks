    ABOUT:  task manager in vim script for plain text task files.
            built to handle an experimental custom task management syntax.
            provides syntax highlighting and custom commands for creating
            structured plaintext task files.
            also good for handling notes but requires manual writing of
            backlinks between files

    IDEA:   want something that allows me to right more strucutred notes, 
            instructions, documents. but i dont want a big cumbersome gui, just
            want to edit txt with some kind of column aligned (or tsv maybe) 
            format.

            really, in its simplest form this is just a bunch of txt files 
            and a system for linking/navigating efficiently, and syntax
            highlighting for viewing/understanding efficiently
