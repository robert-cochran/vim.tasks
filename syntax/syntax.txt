SYNTAX.USECASES

    IDEA:           certain syntax seems to be helpful for certain tasks, and 
                    designing syntax around those tasks might be the most smart
                    (or most useful?) way to go about designing instead of
                    trying to design syntax for every file
                    Examples so far are: 
                    
                    TASKS for general purpose things that i need to do, and 
                    what i have done, and any subtasks or parent tasks this 
                    relates to, and outcome/status so far, blocked status and
                    which file its being blocked by
                    
                    TESTS for keeping track of what the goal is when running 
                    tests, what ive tried so far, and ideas about what i could 
                    try in the future, and outcome so far. also really closely
                    relates to DEBUGGING

                    TICKETS? not sure about this one, might just be a task 
                    with a fancy name

                    DEBUGGING basically tests? not sure if its that much diff
                    yet

                    NOTES for keeping track of handy commands for later, 
                    order of operations, useful tips and tricks, all kinds of 
                    stuff like that, much more could go here but you know what
                    it is
