APPS.TERMINAL
    
    NAME            taskwarrior
        LINK        https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior
        NOTE        its just a terminal app, doesnt suit what my needs
                    are to use vim because of its flexibility, navigation,
                    plugins, syntax, txt based etc..

APPS.EMACS

    NAME (*)        doom emacs
    NOTE            reviews for it are very positive
                    i found command learning annoying, 
                    but maybe just need to power through

APPS.VIM.TASKWARRIOR

    NAME (***)      taskwarrior-tui
                    https://github.com/kdheepak/taskwarrior-tui
        PRO         Awesome interface, very clean, minimal, fast, 
        CON         another app to be beholdent too
        NOTE        use this as an example or influence, having everything
                    as text is really the best long term answer so doing this
                    right means not having to worry about this again forever
                    (as long as I keep it simple that is)

APPS.VIM.ORG

    NAME (*)        vim orgmode
        PROS        syntax highlighting, hyperlinks
        CONS        abandoned 
    NAME            Vim-Orgmode
                    not sure if different from above
                    this is a plugin
                    not maintained
    NAME            VimOrganizer
                    also a plugin
                    also not maintained
                    think both bailed to use emacs orgmode

APPS.VIM.WIKI

    NAME            taskwiki
                    https://github.com/tools-life/taskwiki
                    i like the feature where tasks are collapsed but
                    can be expanded into a full view to show more detail
                    but i dont think i like it enough to use
    NAME (*)        vimwiki
                    http://vimwiki.github.io/
                    https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki
                    Looks good, like the feature to nest todo and store more 
                    details inside. might also be overkill, see wiki.vim
                    for a lighter version
        PRO         Still maintained and very popular
    NAME (*)        wiki.vim
                    simple plugin that creates links back and forth between
                    files, lets you open anywhere, I could use to extend to my 
                    needs

                    Build and run tasks (seems more about prod but still 
                    could be useful for using it to build data files)

PROS+CONS.VIM

    PRO             more stable

    PRO             customizable                    
    PRO             would be good to build          
                        exactly what i want         
                        while using existing

    CON             no gui or mouse control
    CON             steeper learning curve
    CON             will take a lot longer to do
    CON             is only maintained by me
    CON             all the popular plugins/repos for vim seem to be abandoned
                    instead moving over to emacs org-mode using evil (my guess
                    being larger dev community contribution)

PROS+CONS.DESKTOP

    PRO             out of the box

    CON             more chance it will dissapear in teh future
    PRO             smaller learning curve          
    CON             more baggage just to implement simple syntax colouring in 
                    plaintext


PROS+CONS.HTML/JS

    PRO             more stable than app

    PRO             portable to any browser         
    CON             will need to run in browser
    CON             will need to write a text editor
    CON             could get messy

VIM.VS.EMACS

    QUESTION        what does emacs org-mode offer that makes it more
                        attractive than just using vim? 
                    why does everyone jump over?
    QUESTION        does nvim offer anything better than vim?
    QUESTION        does nvim offer anything that rivals or beats org-mode?
